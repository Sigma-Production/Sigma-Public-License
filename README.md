Updates to license will be sent out here.



The Sigma Public License v1.4, introduced by Sigma in 2024, permits free usage, copying, and non-commercial modifications of the software. However, it explicitly prohibits commercial use and renaming for commercial products. Forks are allowed for enhancing the original repository, but they must be clearly marked as contributions. Redistribution is limited to adding content to the repository or creating unmodified copies for archival purposes. The license empowers the original owners to enforce compliance and request takedowns for violations. Owners can also grant special rights at their discretion. The license may change at the owners' discretion, and it disclaims any warranties, with no liability for damages from software use.
